tools/verify-neudrive-cli.sh no longer supports the old heavy verification mode.

Reason:
  The previous full-suite flow could overload local machines by spawning many
  temporary Vola and Go build processes.

Use instead:
  tools/test-neudrive-cli.sh

This runs the safe smoke suite for the Vola CLI without isolated Go caches
or the older heavy platform/import/git stress flow.

tools/verify-neudrive-cli.sh is now a compatibility wrapper.
Forwarding to tools/test-neudrive-cli.sh (safe smoke suite only).

# Platform Coverage Matrix

This matrix tracks the value-based local import surface for `Claude` and `Codex`.

- `files` mode stays a curated raw tree snapshot into `/platforms/<platform>/...`.
- `files` mode does not zip the whole home directory.
- Default import intent is durable, user-meaningful, reconstructable data.
- Low-value runtime noise is excluded from default discovery and default imports.
- `Codex` rows describe the local layout observed by Vola. They do not claim an official on-disk vendor spec.

Status vocabulary:

- `first-class`
- `conversation archive`
- `structured metadata`
- `exact snapshot`
- `excluded`

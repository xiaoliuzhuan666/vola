# Vola Setup Guide

This guide mirrors the connection categories shown in the dashboard's setup page. Use it after your Vola deployment is already running and you want concrete commands or config templates for a specific platform.

The examples below use:

- Hub URL: `https://www.vola.ai`
- MCP URL: `https://www.vola.ai/mcp`
- Scoped token environment variable: `VOLA_TOKEN`

If you are currently running on a local development address such as `http://localhost:8080`, only **Local Mode** is usually appropriate right away. Web / Desktop Apps and CLI Apps generally need a publicly reachable HTTPS URL.

## Web and Desktop Apps

These paths are best when the connection is created from a graphical interface, including browser-based Apps / Connectors and desktop applications such as Cursor and Windsurf.

### Claude Connectors

1. Sign in to the Claude web app and open `Settings -> Connectors -> Go to Customize`.
2. Click `Add custom connector`.
3. Set `Remote MCP Server URL` to `https://www.vola.ai/mcp`.
4. Save and click `Connect`.
5. Your browser will open the Vola sign-in and authorization flow; after approval, return to Claude.

### ChatGPT Apps

1. Sign in to ChatGPT and open `Settings -> Apps`.
2. In `Advanced settings`, click `Create app`.
3. Set `MCP Server URL` to `https://www.vola.ai/mcp`.
4. Follow the prompts to finish Vola sign-in and authorization.

If you do not see the `Apps` entry yet, your plan or rollout cohort probably does not have access to it yet.

### Cursor Desktop

You can add Remote MCP directly in the UI or write the config file manually.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "vola": {
      "url": "https://www.vola.ai/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

Recommended steps:

1. Open `Settings -> Tools & MCPs -> Add Custom MCP`.
2. Set `Remote MCP Server URL` to `https://www.vola.ai/mcp`.
3. Click `Connect` or `Authenticate`.
4. Your browser will open the Vola sign-in and authorization page; when it is complete, return to Cursor.

### Windsurf Desktop

Windsurf currently connects to remote MCP primarily through its config file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "vola": {
      "serverUrl": "https://www.vola.ai/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

Recommended steps:

1. Open `Windsurf Settings -> Cascade`.
2. In the `MCP Servers` section, click `Open MCP Marketplace`.
3. Click the config icon and open `~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json`.
4. Add the `vola` config shown above and save it.
5. Click `Open`, then complete Vola sign-in and authorization.

### What To Do After Connection

After the MCP connection and browser authorization are finished, start a **new chat** in Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, or Windsurf before giving the first import request. In many clients, newly added tools are most reliable in a fresh conversation.

Good first prompts:

- `Please import my skills, projects, and profile into Vola.`
- `Please read my Vola profile, skills, and recent project context, then summarize what is already there.`

If the client is already looking at a specific workspace, repo, or conversation, it can use that local context while writing into Vola. For large file sets or binary assets, prefer [Bundle Sync](./sync.md) after the first setup.

If you need to migrate a large Claude conversation history, the dashboard's official Claude export ZIP importer is usually the most complete and stable path.

## CLI Apps

These paths are best for users who work from the terminal. They connect to Vola through remote HTTP MCP plus OAuth.

### Claude Code

```bash
claude mcp add -s user --transport http vola https://www.vola.ai/mcp
```

Then run this inside Claude Code:

```text
/mcp
```

Then follow the browser authorization flow.

### Codex CLI

```bash
codex mcp add vola --url https://www.vola.ai/mcp
codex mcp login vola
codex mcp list
```

### Gemini CLI

```bash
gemini mcp add --transport http vola https://www.vola.ai/mcp
```

Then run this inside Gemini:

```text
/mcp auth vola
```

Important: `gemini mcp add` must include `--transport http`, or Gemini may treat the URL as a local command instead of a remote MCP server.

### Cursor Agent

First write this into `.cursor/mcp.json` or `~/.cursor/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "vola": {
      "url": "https://www.vola.ai/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

Then run:

```bash
cursor-agent mcp login vola
cursor-agent mcp list
```

### What To Do After CLI Setup

After the MCP entry is added and login/auth is complete, start a **new session** in the CLI client if possible, then give it a direct import task. Terminal clients usually work best when the tool is already present before the conversation begins.

Good first prompts:

- `Please import this workspace's useful skills, project context, and profile/preferences into Vola.`
- `Please save the current repo context into Vola as a project, then tell me what was written.`
- `Please scan this workspace and store the reusable skills and profile hints you find in Vola.`

If the CLI client is already opened inside a repo or workspace, it can usually use that local context directly. If the tool does not seem available yet, restart the client or open a fresh session before trying again.

## Local Mode

Local mode is best for local development, internal-network environments, or any setup that does not yet have a public HTTPS URL. It connects through the local `vola-mcp` binary and a scoped token.

First prepare a token:

```bash
export VOLA_TOKEN=ndt_xxxxx
```

### Claude Code

```bash
claude mcp add -s user vola -- vola-mcp --token-env VOLA_TOKEN
```

### Codex CLI

```bash
codex mcp add vola -- vola-mcp --token-env VOLA_TOKEN
```

If you only want to inspect the setup and do not want to mint a token yet, open `Connection Setup -> Local Mode` in the dashboard. You can create and copy a mode-specific token there when you are ready.

### What To Do After Local Mode Setup

Once the local MCP binary and token are configured, open a **new session** in the connected client and ask it to import from the current machine context.

Good first prompts:

- `Please import this local workspace into Vola, including project context, useful skills, and profile/preferences.`
- `Please save the current repo into Vola as a project and tell me which files or notes were imported.`

Local Mode is especially good when the agent can already read local files directly. For bulk or binary-heavy imports, use [Bundle Sync](./sync.md) after the first connection test.

## Advanced Mode

Advanced mode targets generic clients that support HTTP MCP. Prefer environment variables whenever possible, and only fall back to a static Bearer header when the client cannot read tokens from env.

```bash
export VOLA_TOKEN=ndt_xxxxx
```

Codex CLI can reference the environment variable directly so the secret does not need to be written into config:

```bash
codex mcp add vola --url https://www.vola.ai/mcp --bearer-token-env-var VOLA_TOKEN
```

For other clients, use a static Bearer configuration only if env-based auth is not supported yet.

### What To Do After Advanced Setup

After auth is wired up, verify the client can actually call Vola before asking it to do a larger import.

Good first prompts:

- `Please confirm you can access Vola, then save a short test note and tell me where it was written.`
- `Please read my Vola profile, then import the current project context into Vola if this client can access the workspace.`

If the client is chat-only and cannot see local files or the current repo, paste the content you want stored and ask it to write that content into `profile`, `project`, or `memory` explicitly.

## ChatGPT GPT Actions

If you want to connect Vola to a custom GPT, use GPT Actions:

1. Open ChatGPT and create a GPT.
2. Go to `Configure -> Actions`.
3. Set `OpenAPI Schema URL` to `https://www.vola.ai/gpt/openapi.json`.
4. Choose `Bearer Token` for authentication.
5. Use a scoped token as the Bearer token.

The recommended path is to create a dedicated token first in `Connection Setup -> Token Management`.

### What To Do After GPT Actions Setup

After the GPT is configured, start a **new chat with that GPT** and explicitly tell it what to save. Unlike workspace-aware desktop or CLI clients, GPT Actions usually do not automatically see your local repo or editor context.

Good first prompts:

- `Please save the following preferences into my Vola profile/preferences: ...`
- `Please create a project called launch-plan in Vola and save the following notes there: ...`
- `Please store this reusable prompt or skill draft in Vola and tell me where you saved it.`

If you want automatic workspace-scale import, prefer [Web and Desktop Apps](#web-and-desktop-apps) or [CLI Apps](#cli-apps) instead of GPT Actions.

## Adapters

Adapters are meant for workspace platforms such as Feishu, DingTalk, and Slack. The currently documented example in this repo is the Feishu Bot Adapter.

### Feishu Bot Adapter

Callback URL format:

```text
https://www.vola.ai/api/adapters/feishu/<your-slug>/events
```

Server-side environment variables:

```bash
FEISHU_APP_ID=replace-with-your-app-id
FEISHU_APP_SECRET=replace-with-your-app-secret
FEISHU_VERIFICATION_TOKEN=replace-with-your-verification-token
FEISHU_ENCRYPT_KEY=replace-with-your-encrypt-key
```

Recommended steps:

1. Create a custom app in the Feishu developer console and enable bot capability.
2. Subscribe to `Messages and Groups -> Receive Messages v2.0`.
3. Choose `Send events to developer server`.
4. Use the callback URL above as the request URL.
5. Configure `FEISHU_APP_ID`, `FEISHU_APP_SECRET`, and `FEISHU_VERIFICATION_TOKEN` on the server.
6. It is strongly recommended to also configure `FEISHU_ENCRYPT_KEY` so signature validation and event decryption are enabled.

### What To Do After Adapter Setup

After the adapter is live, send it a test message and ask it to store something in Vola so you can verify the end-to-end path.

Good first prompts:

- `Save this note to Vola memory: ...`
- `Create or update a project in Vola called launch-plan with this summary: ...`
- `Store this preference in my Vola profile: ...`

Adapters are best for message-driven updates and lightweight capture. For larger repo or workspace imports, use one of the MCP-based modes above.

## Token Management

Token management is not a separate connection mode, but almost every non-OAuth path depends on it.

From the dashboard you can:

- Create scoped tokens
- Choose presets such as read-only, agent full, or sync
- Select scopes manually
- Rename, revoke, or rotate tokens

## Bundle Sync

For large skills, long-form documents, PNG / PDF assets, and other binary resources, prefer Bundle Sync instead of having AI write files one by one through MCP tools.

- [Bundle Sync guide](./sync.md)
- [Prod-like acceptance runbook](./sync-prodlike-acceptance.md)
- [Security and resource audit](./sync-audit.md)
